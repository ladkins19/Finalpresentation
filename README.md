# Final Presentation


The main component of my project was theoretical modeling, or “what if” type of creations.

To begin this process, I began researching materials that could replicate what the different components of a cell would potentially feel like. 

Since there are so many aspects of eukaryotic cells, I began prioritizing based on the most prominent components. The first was cytoplasm, since it quite literally cradles everything else inside the cell. Cytoplasm is the essentially the lifeblood. 

Based on research from electron microscope images, as well as videos of microscopic dissections of cells, I was able to develop a general premise for my own research of materials. 

Based on my research I knew a few things about the attributes I wanted my material to possess. The first was that I wanted my material to be a non-Newtonian fluid, and I wanted it to be clear.

In order to make a non-Newtonian fluid, I needed polymers and borate ions. The fancy terms for glue (polyvinyl acetate) my synthetic polymer, and the detergent, borax (sodium borate). These images display what I used. 

I mixed the ratio of borax to water to glue together and this was the first result. The way it looked was consistent with what I wanted. This is an electron microscope image of a eukaryotic cell which I chose to show because I think it shows the aesthetic consistency between it and my synthetic cytoplasmic material. 

I wasn’t very happy with the amount of bubbles so I covered my material and let it set for about 6 hours to see if the bubbles would rise and dissipate. Some did, but not as much as I would have liked. 

Next, I pulled a big chunk of my material out of the bowl and shaped it. I set it down and kind of pushed it around and “opened it up” if you will. This is when I decided to investigate how this material might hold an additional component, just as cytoplasm does to the innards of a cell. 

I wanted to add a nucleus. For this experiment, I chose a strawberry to act as my nucleus. This wasn’t a random “what’s in the fridge that I could use” type of decision. I chose a strawberry because they are octoploid. They have huge genomes, and they look relatively similar to what you might find in a diagram of eukaryotic cell, with these seeds here and such.

I set my nucleus inside the shallow portion of my material

 and began folding it over. My material was great in that it settled into itself really nicely. I reshaped it, and this was the result.

This will give you a better idea of the stiffness and elasticity of the material. Wasn’t really what I wanted. Needed something more elastic and mailable.

So I went back to my material and added a bit more water. Which made things much more mailable and flexible. It also improved the clarity a bit.

I preformed the same experiment with the strawberry, placing it, folding this over.

And these were the results, which I was much more pleased with. Aesthetically, they are much better in my opinion. 

Here is another video which displays the improved elasticity and flexibility. 

For the sake of time I will end here. 

What I am continuing to work on is refining my material in regards to clarity, and further researching how to replicate the inner components of a cell.
